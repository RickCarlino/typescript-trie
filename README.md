# Typescript Trie Implementation

This is a trie implementation that I wrote as part of a job search/interview prep in early 2022.

# Features

 * Classless design - uses simple interfaces and datastructures.
 * Support `search`, `insert` and `remove` operations.
 * Simple implementation

# TODO

 * Ability to `list` all entries in a tree
 * Ability to perform wildcard search

# Testing

The test suite is minimal.

```shell
ts-node tests.ts
```

# Install

This implementation is small and infrequently updated. You can probably just copy/paste it into your project. Please raise an issue if you would like me to publish it to NPM.
